# Pac-Man Factory
 Pac-Man Factory is a Vanilla JavaScript activity that creates, (randomly) moves, and removes Pac-Men from the screen.

This activity is a good practice for understanding Object Creation using the
 Factory Method, as well as DOM Manipulation by adding, moving, and
 removing Pac-Men from the screen.
 
 Using setTimeout() for the animation is a good way to ease into asynchronous functions.
 
 Checking for boundary collisions was a good exercise in JavaScript Objects.
 
 Additionally, I added:
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Bootstrap
